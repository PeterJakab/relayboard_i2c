1. copy and extract libraries to the Raspberry Pi
$ wget https://github.com/PeterJakab/relayboard_i2c/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip

2. install the libraries and tools on the Raspberry Pi
$ sudo apt-get install python3-smbus i2c-tools python3-usb

3. add your user to the i2c group
$ sudo usermod -a -G i2c pi

4. setup the Raspberry Pi pins
Start the config utility
$ sudo raspi-config
Go to 5. Interfacing options
Select P5 I2C
Select yes to enable the I2C interface
Select Finish
Power off the Raspberry Pi
$ sudo poweroff
Remove power from the Raspbeery Pi by unplugging the microUSB cord

5. connect the relay module to the Raspberry Pi pins as described
P1 pin - CN21 pin, refer to http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout
1 (3V3) - 1 (VDD)
9 (GND) - 2 (GND)
3 (SDA) - 3 (SDA)
5 (SCL) - 4 (SCL)

connect power to CN22 on the relay module.
* if the blue relays on the relay module are 12VDC, use a 12V DC power supply
* if the blue relays on the relay module are 5VDC, use a 5V DC power supply

6. power on the Raspberry Pi and edit the example code as necessary:

If necessary, adjust the bus and address parameters in the test_i2c.py file:
r = relayboard.Relayboard(type='i2c-8ch', bus=0, address=0x20)

where
* bus is 0 for older Raspberry Pi-s and 1 for the Raspberry Pi Zero (W)
* address is setup with SW1 on the board, the default is 0x20 (switches are ON)

Run the example code:
$ ./test_i2c.py

Enter a channel number between 1 and 8
Enter On, Off or Toggle
Listen to the relay clicking
